# LLM Dialogue Sandbox
LLM Dialogue Sandbox is a Python framework designed for orchestrating, transcribing, and analyzing dialogues between two Large Language Models (LLMs). It serves as an experimental sandbox to study emergent behaviors, conversational patterns, and the influence of external information on AI interactions.  The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple yet powerful tool for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore how LLMs converse with each other. Future development will focus on enhancing the ability to manually inject specific context into either agent during a conversation, allowing for targeted experiments on influence and reasoning.
